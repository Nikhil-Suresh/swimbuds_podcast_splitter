# Swimbuds Podcast Splitter
A simple Python CLI tool which will split up long audio files, such as podcasts, into smaller, sorted files so that you can actually get rewind functionality without restarting the whole podcast episode.

To run, simply execute split_podcast.py from the prompt using Python. The process will take around a minute.
